Intan.jl - Julia Electrophysiology Interface
===============================================

Intan.jl is a graphical interface for viewing and processing extracellular electrophysiology 
data being collected in real time. This system works out of the box with Intan Technologies 
RHD2000-Series Amplifier Evaluation System, but could be configured to work with other systems that expose 
their acquisition API like Intan.
